# Falcon Controller Kit :metal:
This is a set of code segments to control falcon drones. The controller kit will be fully assembled by the end of **April 2019** :tada:.


## Components

1. PCB Board 10cm x 15cm x 1.6mm.
2. ESP8266 Node MCU micro controller. :heart_eyes:
3. MPU6050 6axis Motion Sensor
4. BMP180 Barometric/Temperature/Altitude Sensor

## Languages
C/C++ For micro controller instructions. :wink:


# Features

* **Detect orientation**
  * MPU6050 Accelerometer to detect linear acceleration
  * MPU6050 Gyroscope to determine orientation
* **Detect Temperature**
  * MPU6050 to determine temperature
* **Detect Height and Air Pressure**
  * Converts air pressure to altitude values.


## Challenges

1. Writing ES code is challenging and requires a lot of research.
2. Printing PCB board.
3. Design and modularity of the  circuitry.
